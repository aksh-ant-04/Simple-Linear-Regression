# Linear Regression Model

## Objective
Developed and evaluated a linear regression model to predict a target variable based on dataset features (i.e. Advertising.csv).

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Description

1. Implemented a linear regression model to predict target values from given features using scikit-learn.

2. Performed data preprocessing including cleaning, normalization, and feature encoding to prepare the dataset for modeling.
   
3. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess prediction accuracy.

4. Visualized results to identify patterns and residuals, improving understanding of model performance and areas for improvement.

## How to Run
- Run the script using `python scripts/main.py`.
